# Count Monitoring Starter Solution

Logs events when a button is pressed (or other digital sensor triggered).  
Additional information about the event can be added by triggering a variable number of secondary sensors.  
Uses the [Sequent Microsystems 16 input HAT](https://sequentmicrosystems.com/products/16-universal-inputs-card-for-raspberry-pi) for 24V sensors.
